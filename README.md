# AlgoViz (Terminal-Based Algorithm Visualizer)

AlgoViz is a simple terminal-based Algorithm Visualizer implemented in Java. It operates on a **matrix-based search space**, providing a step-by-step visualization of various traversal and pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Visualizes different traversal and pathfinding algorithms** in a matrix grid.
- **Displays real-time step-by-step traversal output** in the terminal.
- **Customizable matrix input** (size, source, and destination).
- **Interactive and simple user interface**.
- **Supports multiple algorithms**, allowing for easy expansion.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hetparekh21/AlgoViz
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd AlgoViz
   ```
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the visualizer:
   ```sh
   java AlgoViz
   ```
2. Input the **matrix size** as prompted.
3. Enter the **source (`@`) and destination (`$`) positions**.
4. Choose an algorithm from the menu.
5. View the **step-by-step traversal visualization** in the terminal.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)'
